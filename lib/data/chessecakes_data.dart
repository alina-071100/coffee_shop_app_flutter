        "Dry cappuccinos (also known as cappuccini scurro or dark cappuccinos) have less milk than the other cappuccinos. There is a little steamed milk mixed in, but there is more foamed milk layered on top of the drink. The taste of the espresso is stronger in this drink, and the liquid part of the drink is darker in color than it is in a traditional cappuccino. The milky foam on top of the drink insulates the drink, keeping it hotter longer.",

Popular flavors include vanilla, chocolate, caramel, peppermint, raspberry, and cinnamon. Sometimes, other additives (such as powdered cinnamon or cocoa, or drizzled caramel or chocolate sauce) are also added on top of the cappuccino's foam.",
